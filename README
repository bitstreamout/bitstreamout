      The bitstreamout plugin for VDR
      ===============================

What it is:
A plugin which receive the data stream of AC3 (Dolby Digital[tm]),
DTS[tm] (Digital Theater System[tm]), and linear PCM in playback
and live mode of VDR.  The data received is send to the S/P-DIF
of the sound card.  Whereby the none PCM data is embedded into
an appropriate PCM data stream to ensure that the A/V receiver with
its decoder unit is able to handle the data therein.  For a full
description read the file Description.

What is not:
This plugin does _not_ decode any data received. This because the
author do not want not injure any patent, intellectual property
and/or license of the Dolby Labs Inc. nor those from DTS[tm].
This is the reason why you need a legal hardware or software
decoder, e.g. a A/V receiver of amplifier connected on the S/P-DIF
of your sound card or a sound card which is able to decode the
data stream.   For the last case you may modify on of the
mute scripts found in the directory mute/.

How to install:
Read the file INSTALL.
