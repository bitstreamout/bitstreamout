      Known problems with bitstreamout plugin for VDR
      ===============================================

* Required is shm support.  Note: all Linux system should have this
  support already in the kernel.  If your kernel does not provide
  shm you have to activate shared memory filesystem in the kernel.
  Don't to forget to reboot the system.  If shm is available and
  not already used (e.g. for udev with mounted /dev), execute

	mount -v -o mode=1777 -t tmpfs tmpfs /dev/shm

  and you should see a line like this:

	tmpfs on /dev/shm type shm (rw)

  Add the mount line below the line of activating swap (swapon)
  within your boot scripts if you system boot script not already
  do this.

* Do NEVER use the `-a' option of VDR in combination
  with the bitstreamout plugin.  NEVER, because
  both try to open the S/P-DIF of your sound card
  and the first block the other.

* If you're using the configuration `Nonlinear' for the option
  `Mp2Out' and your hear nothing or your speakers are very noisy
  you may switch your A/V receiver into Mpeg Audio mode or, if
  your A/V receiver does not support Mpeg Audio you should use
  `Dither' for the option `Mp2Out'.

* If you've problems with the command

        make plugins

  in the main directory of VDR you should set a
  symbolic link in the directory PLUGINS/src/

        ln -sf bitstreamout-<version> bitstreamout

  with e.g. <version>=0.45b -> see PLUGINS.html.

* Please use VDR 1.6.0 and higher.
  For any user of DVB cards from TT and similar, please
  load the module dvb-ttpci(.o) with the option hw_sections=0
  to switch off the scan of the EPG data on the card
  its self. This because this will be done by VDR.

* This plugin for VDR 1.6.0 and higher requires ALSA
  1.0.0 and higher.

* Some other plugins (old teletext plugin?) ar known to cause
  problems with audio synch loose or dropouts due to missing
  ringbuffer feature and/or time consuming scanner in the
  Receive() part instead of returning as fast as possible.
