      C-Media PCI CMI8738 based sound cards
      =====================================

Warning: there are CMI8738 chips which do not have S/P-DIF in/out!

Besides this a C-Media PCI CMI8738 based sound card or onboard
sound chip should have a 2x8 pin connector block with pin 3 empty:

  Left AUX in     1  2   Right AUX in
  Empty           3  4   Ground
  S/P-DIF in      5  6   Ground
  S/P-DIF out     7  8   Ground

There exist some extension boards (optical and/or coax S/P-DIF in
and/or S/P-DIF out).  Some of these extension boards also have
a jumper to use further 2 pin connector for PC internal S/P-DIF.
